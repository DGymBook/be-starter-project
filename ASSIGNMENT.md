# Payment Methods Feature - Interview Assignment

## 🎯 Task

Implement a **Payment Methods** feature and **Payment Tracking** for the Open DGymBook API. 

### Requirements
1. Gyms can configure multiple payment methods (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Transfer, PayPal). Each method should be scoped to the gym and editable.
2. For every membership created, create a new payment/transaction record capturing all the required data.
3. Each payment record must reference the selected payment method  so the chosen method is persisted with the transaction.
4. Maintain proper database relationships
5. Follow existing codebase patterns

## ⏰ Time Limit
**2.5 hours**

## 🔍 What We're Looking For
- Database design and relationships
- API design following existing patterns
- Code quality and consistency with existing codebase
- Proper testing of your implementation

## 📚 Getting Started
1. Study the existing codebase structure
2. Understand current database schema and API patterns
3. Plan your implementation
4. Build and test your feature

## 📝 Deliverables
- Working payment methods and payments APIs
- Database schema with proper relationships
- Test your endpoints and show they work
- Brief explanation of your design decisions

## 📤 Repository & Submission
- Create a Git repository on your personal GitHub account and keep it public, or fork this repository and work from your fork.
- Push all your commits to that repository and keep it up to date.
- Share the repository link with us when you submit — you do not need to host the project anywhere (a GitHub repo is sufficient).
- Include a clear, well-written `README.md` that explains how to run and test your implementation.

Good luck and thanks for taking the assignment!
